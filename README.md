This repository was developed only to apply to the <b>Adomi</b> selection process as an evaluation criteria, and it contains all exercises and challenges solved by me. 

## üéØ Exercises

 ##### I) First exercise
 - [x] a) <b>[ps-adomi/exercises/1st/default.js]</b> Create a function to check if a number is odd or even and apply it on  the following list to print which numbers are even and which numbers are odd: list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
 
 - [x] b) <b>[ps-adomi/exercises/1st/challenge.js]</b>  Given a list of integer numbers, print on screen if its numbers are odd or even just using a single line.


 ##### II) Second exercise
 - [x] a) <b>[ps-adomi/exercises/2st/default.js]</b> Write an algorithm that storage the value "19" inside an "a" variable and the value "23" inside a "b" variable. Next, swipe their contents making the value inside "a" switch to "b" and vice-versa. At the end, print the values storaged in each variable.
 
 - [x] b) <b>[ps-adomi/exercises/2st/challenge.js]</b> Write an algorithm that storage the value "19" inside an "a" variable and the value "23" inside a "b" variable. Next, swipe their contents making the value inside "a" switch to "b"  and vice-versa without use a third variable. At the end, print the values storaged in each variable.


 ##### III) Third exercise
 - [x] a) <b>[ps-adomi/exercises/3st/default.js]</b> Create a function that save the Fibonacci series numbers until it reaches a "x" (parameter) iterations inside an array and print its values.
 
 - [x] b) <b>[ps-adomi/exercises/3st/1st_challenge.js]</b> Given a "getFibonacciSequence()" function, create another function that receives it fibonacci sequence array and returns the sum of its elements.

 - [x] b) <b>[ps-adomi/exercises/3st/2nd_challenge.js]</b> Given a "getFibonacciSequence()" function, create another function that receives it fibonacci sequence array and returns the sum of its elements using a different algorithm than the third exercise first challenge.

## ü§ñ How to test it

This application can be tested in two different ways:

 1. <b>Manually</b>, by using a vanilla javascript interpreter. Eg. v8;
 2. <b>Automatically</b>, by using node and jest.

For the second option, you'll need:

 - The latest long term support node.js version installed on your environment;
 - NPM (Node Package Manager) or Yarn.

When all requirements are already met, run the code below on your terminal:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/eliasbiondo/adomi-ps.git
cd adomi-ps</code>
</pre>

If you're using NPM (Node Package Manager):

<pre><code>npm install
npm test</code>
</pre>

If you're using Yarn:
<pre><code>yarn install
yarn test</code>
</pre>
